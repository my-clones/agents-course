# Concepts

## Agent

Agent is: an **AI model capable of reasoning, planning, and interacting with its environment.**

User request: â†’ REASON â†’ PLAN â†’ ACT (Agentt's List of known tools)

More formal way.

"An Agent is a system that leverages an **AI model** to **interact** with its **environment** in order to **achieve a user-defined objective**. 
It combines:
1. reasoning, 
2. planning, and 
3. the execution of actions (often via external tools) to fulfill tasks."

ðŸ”¶ BRAIN â†’ **AI model (LLM/BLM)**: 
decision process: which Actions to take based on the situation (reasoning & planning)

ðŸ”¶ BODY  â†’ **Capabilities and Tools**
Scope of **possible actions** depends on what the agent has been equipped with

> Note that Actions are not the same as Tools. 
> An Action, for instance, can involve the use of multiple Tools to complete.

An Agent is a system that uses an AI Model (typically an LLM) as its core reasoning engine, to:

* Understand natural language: Interpret and respond to human instructions in a meaningful way.
+ Reason and plan: Analyze information, make decisions, and devise strategies to solve problems.
* Interact with its environment: Gather information, take actions, and observe the results of those actions.

Quiz

Q1: Which of the following best describes an AI Agent?
> An AI model that can reason, plan, and use tools to interact with its environment to achieve a specific goal.

Q2: What is the Role of Planning in an Agent?
> To decide on the sequence of actions and select appropriate tools needed to fulfill the userâ€™s request.

Q3: How Do Tools Enhance an Agentâ€™s Capabilities?
> Tools provide the Agent with the ability to execute actions a text-generation model cannot perform natively, such as making coffee or generating images.

Q4: How Do Actions Differ from Tools?
> Actions are the steps the Agent takes, while Tools are external resources the Agent can use to perform those actions.

Q5: What Role Do Large Language Models (LLMs) Play in Agents?
> LLMs serve as the reasoning 'brain' of the Agent, processing text inputs to understand instructions and plan actions.

Q6: Which of the Following Best Demonstrates an AI Agent?
> A virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa that can understand spoken commands, reason through them, and perform tasks like setting reminders or sending messages.
